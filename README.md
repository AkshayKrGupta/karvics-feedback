# Karvics Feedback & Community Hub 🚀

Welcome to the official public repository for [Karvics.com](https://karvics.com) — a suite of free, privacy-first, and offline-capable developer tools.

This repository serves as our **Public Issue Tracker** and **Feature Request Board**. While the core engine of Karvics is proprietary, we believe in building in the open with our community.
